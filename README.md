#### 1.Traffic Flow Model



##### 1.1 Traffic Flow

​    in this section we propose a traffic flow model to measure the burden of traffic,  we take the length of car, the speed of different vehicles lanes of roads together to measure how large the traffic flow is in the normal time and peak time.

​     math equations....

​     traffic flow evaluation 

​     road capacity evaluation 

​     congestion evaluation 

​     sensitivity analyze

​     Graphs shows the result 

##### 1.2 Interaction between self-Driving and non-self-driving cars

1. a table shows the difference between self-driving cars and non-self driving cars

2. V(d) Graphs

3. get the optimal result 

   ​

#### 2.Dynamic Congestion Propagation Model

##### 2.1 Bayesian network and belief propagation

##### 2.2 Simulate Result



#### 3.Cooperating Navigation Model

##### 3.1 Flow Network

##### 3.2 Source And Sink Analyze

##### 3.3 Minimum Cost Maxinum Flow

##### 3.4 Sensitivity Analyze
